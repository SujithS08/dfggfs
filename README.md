🧠 Overview Section
This section offers a high-level snapshot of the dataset:

Average Assessment Score: Displays the mean score across all students.

Average Comprehension & Attention: Highlights key cognitive skill averages.

Total Students: Shows the number of students analyzed.
These metrics are presented in clean, bordered cards for quick readability and comparison.

📊 Analytics Section
This area dives deeper into performance trends using interactive charts:

Bar Chart (Skill Averages): Compares average values of comprehension, attention, focus, and retention across the student population.

Scatter Plot (Attention vs Score): Visualizes the correlation between attention levels and assessment scores, helping identify patterns like high attention leading to better performance.

Radar Chart (Top Student Profile): Displays the cognitive skill profile of the highest-scoring student, offering a holistic view of their strengths.

🧍 Personas Section
Students are grouped into learning personas using clustering techniques:

Each student is tagged with a persona label (e.g., Persona A, B, C) based on their cognitive traits.

These personas help educators tailor interventions—for example, students with high attention but low retention may benefit from spaced repetition techniques.
